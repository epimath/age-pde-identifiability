Pdf copies are provided along with each example file. The file naming conventions are as follows:

- ODE or PDE indicates the type of model
- 'incidence' and 'kIprev' indicate the type of output used
- 'frequency' and 'density' indicate frequency and density dependent transmission
- 'immigration' indicates that the model includes immigration of new individuals
- 'bc' or 'ic' indicates evaluation of specific boundary or initial conditions
